KEYWORD NETWORK ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
======================================================================

1. CE keywords acting as bridges to AI terms: tunnel, concrete (high betweenness centrality indicates these terms frequently co-occur with AI concepts across multiple articles).

2. AI concepts dominating across CE domains: artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning (highest weighted degree indicates these AI terms co-occur most frequently with various CE keywords).

3. Network communities reveal interpretable themes: Community 2 (10 nodes): CE terms like construction, concrete, infrastructure and AI terms like robotics, generative ai, artificial intelligence; Community 1 (4 nodes): CE terms like structural and AI terms like neural networks, machine learning, computer vision.

4. In the CE-only network, core concepts include: infrastructure, construction, structural, showing the fundamental civil engineering domains that form the backbone of the keyword network.

5. The bipartite network (CE <-> AI only) shows strongest connections between: infrastructure (CE), artificial intelligence (AI), automation (AI), indicating the most prominent cross-domain relationships.
