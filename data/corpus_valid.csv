Smart Cities World,https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/the-threat-of-urban-canyons-to-autonomous-vehicles-5468,,The threat of urban canyons to autonomous vehicles,"The continued growth of skyscrapers and urban infrastructure means AVs are at risk of signal black-out in cities across the world, warns UK-based AV software specialist, Oxbotica.
Autonomous vehicles (AV) are at risk of signal black-out caused by “urban canyons” in cities across the world due to the continued growth of skyscrapers and urban infrastructure, warns UK-based AV software specialist, Oxbotica.
Urban canyons are formed when a street is densely populated by tall buildings on both sides. This can cause the GPS signal at ground level to be degraded or lost which has potential safety and operational implications for AV systems that rely heavily on satellite-based navigation.
The number of tall buildings (above 200m) has risen by 650 per cent in the last five years (according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat). And with this number set to increase again by up to 20 per cent in 2020, the frequency of urban canyons in cities is only set to grow, according to Oxbotica.
Even a standard three-storey building is enough to create signal disruption at ground level, it reports. And the problem is worse at higher latitudes where satellites tend to be lower in the sky. If no suitable fallbacks are in place, this can affect autonomous vehicles in these environments, including mass transit shuttles, buses, city delivery vehicles and cars, the company reports.
However, canyons are not the only issue with GPS dependency. Sunspots formed during the sun’s 11-year magnetic field cycle cause marked changes in the solar wind. This impacts the upper atmosphere which can in turn interfere with GPS satellites. The solution is to use a mix of radars, cameras and lasers to navigate and localise rather than relying solely on GPS.
“There are so many urban canyons and GPS ‘blind spots’ across our towns, cities and countryside, that we can’t rely on GPS for accurate navigation,” said Ben Upcroft, vice president of technology at Oxbotica.
“While this may pose a problem for some autonomous vehicles, our software is designed to mitigate this and is able to work independently of a GPS signal, helping us to bring autonomy to any vehicle in any environment – this is the central focus of our Universal Autonomy vision.”
“There are so many urban canyons and GPS ‘blind spots’ across our towns, cities and countryside, that we can’t rely on GPS for accurate navigation”
Oxbotica claims its autonomy technology is able to work independently of any external infrastructure, allowing continuous localisation and safe control of its vehicles – even without a GPS signal. The company said its localisation system is not reliant on a single sensor modality, and instead uses a mixture of radar, laser and vision sensing to deliver autonomous operation in a vast range of settings, on any vehicle platform, under any conditions.
This technology has already operated in a range of environments without access to GPS, for example in mines and quarries, inside warehouses, and in urban canyons across Europe, Asia and America. It uses the same software to run autonomous vehicles, in any environment, without needing to change a single line of code.
“While it is harder to figure out your location using vehicle-mounted sensors rather than being told it by GPS, the rewards are many. Entirely new commercial opportunities open up – working underground is no different to a high street, an autonomous shuttle is no different to a haulage truck in a mine,” added Paul Newman, CTO and founder at Oxbotica.

Most people now live in cities which are the epicentres of human activity. While covering 3 per cent of earth's surface, cities consume 78 per cent of the world's energy and produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.
With this in mind, SmartCitiesWorld and our Advisory Board (made up of cities, city networks and industry experts) have put forward 10 principles that we believe should be reflected in any COP26 agreement. (You can read our Special Report by our Editor, Luke Antoniou)
These principles will help us all in the move towards net zero carbon emissions and also immeasurably improve the lives of a city's citizens.
Pledge your support and help SmartCitiesWorld spotlight the critical role cities will play in delivering a sustainable future, and how important it is that they are given the full support of national governments in doing so.
INCLUSION: Including all citizens in decision making drives the best results. The hallmarks of good city governance are participation, transparency, accountability and open data.
DIVERSITY: Encouraging diversity is a key principle in fostering city-scale resilience and sustainability.
RESILIENCE: Cities with a resilience strategy are better equipped to protect their citizens and environment from the worst effects of climate change.
WELLBEING: City strategies measured by wellbeing indices deliver better long term outcomes than cities driven by economic measure alone.
GREEN SPACES: The cities that create and preserve green spaces for native trees and flora create bigger long-term resilience, wellbeing, and prosperity for their citizens and the bio-sphere.
NATIONAL-LEVEL SUPPORT: Cities committing to net-zero targets and a 'just transition' should be actively encouraged and supported by national government programmes to help nations achieve their ambitions.
INFRA-STRUCTURE: The best cities give citizens access to infrastructure that provides physical safety, clean sanitation, waste disposal, clean air, a renewable energy supply, digital connectivity.
SYSTEMS THINKING: Nations that equip leaders with systems thinking, including the ability to build on system synergies and circular economy principles, are most likely to meet their challenging net zero targets.
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY: Cities using secure digital technology to measure and manage activity across city-systems are more able to bring about effective local change then those without the data.
HEALTHY TRANSPORT: Prioritising active transport, then public transport, then private transport is the way to go.

With this in mind, SmartCitiesWorld and our Advisory Board (made up of cities, city networks and industry experts) have put forward 10 principles that we believe should be reflected in any COP26 agreement. (You can read our Special Report by our Editor, Luke Antoniou)
These principles will help us all in the move towards net zero carbon emissions and also immeasurably improve the lives of a city's citizens.
Pledge your support and help SmartCitiesWorld spotlight the critical role cities will play in delivering a sustainable future, and how important it is that they are given the full support of national governments in doing so.
INCLUSION: Including all citizens in decision making drives the best results. The hallmarks of good city governance are participation, transparency, accountability and open data.
DIVERSITY: Encouraging diversity is a key principle in fostering city-scale resilience and sustainability.
RESILIENCE: Cities with a resilience strategy are better equipped to protect their citizens and environment from the worst effects of climate change.
WELLBEING: City strategies measured by wellbeing indices deliver better long term outcomes than cities driven by economic measure alone.
GREEN SPACES: The cities that create and preserve green spaces for native trees and flora create bigger long-term resilience, wellbeing, and prosperity for their citizens and the bio-sphere.
NATIONAL-LEVEL SUPPORT: Cities committing to net-zero targets and a 'just transition' should be actively encouraged and supported by national government programmes to help nations achieve their ambitions.
INFRA-STRUCTURE: The best cities give citizens access to infrastructure that provides physical safety, clean sanitation, waste disposal, clean air, a renewable energy supply, digital connectivity.
SYSTEMS THINKING: Nations that equip leaders with systems thinking, including the ability to build on system synergies and circular economy principles, are most likely to meet their challenging net zero targets.
DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY: Cities using secure digital technology to measure and manage activity across city-systems are more able to bring about effective local change then those without the data.
HEALTHY TRANSPORT: Prioritising active transport, then public transport, then private transport is the way to go.

In the latest SmartCitiesWorld City Profile, we’re turning our attention to the city of Madrid. Spain’s capital, Madrid is nation’s largest city and has the second-most populous metropolitan area in the EU. Known for its vibrant economy and high standard of living, Madrid generates an estimated 12 per cent of Spain’s GDP and employs more than 10 per cent of the country’s workforce.
The city is a financial and commercial centre in Southern Europe with a thriving service sector that drives the local economy, accounting for almost 80 per cent of its output. Madrid maintains a strong industrial presence, with advantages in infrastructure and its position as a vital transport hub.
Our City Profiles act as a toolbox for other cities, splitting out the city’s challenges and matching them to solutions that demonstrate exactly how technology, policy and investment come together to overcome both every-day and long-term issues. Here, we’re focusing on the city of Madrid’s:
